👋 Hi, I’m @MaxGog or just Max

👀 I’m interested in UWP programs 🐱‍👤, C# programs, Xamarin (NOT .NET MAUI), and games (artwork too). I can also write something in C++ and Python, the experience was. I also have experience working with app stores such as:
- Microsoft Store 💻
- NashStore 📱
- Galaxy Store 📱
- Google Play 📱

I'm still a student and just learning;) I am involved in several of my projects that will be released a little later. In the meantime, here are my products:
- Choosing gadgets:

     * 📱 NashStore: https://store.nashstore.ru/store/62becd8afb3ed32a91926816
- Portal Network:
     * 🖥 Site: https://portal.net.ru/
     * 💻 Microsoft Store: https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PBLB8DCD93J

I can also work on Unity and work with 3D objects. In principle, I understand and use computers very well💻
