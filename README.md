👋 Hi, I’m @MaxGog or just Max

👀 I’m interested in UWP programs 🐱‍👤, C# programs, .NET MAUI, and games (artwork too). I can also write something in C++ and Python. I also have experience working with app stores such as:
- Microsoft Store 💻
- RuStore 📱
- [Google Play 📱💻](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8907255934424789335)
