👋 Hi, I’m @MaxGog or just Max

👀 I’m interested in UWP programs 🐱‍👤, C# programs, Xamarin (NOT .NET MAUI), and games (artwork too). I can also write something in C++ and Python, the experience was. I also have experience working with app stores such as:
- Microsoft Store 💻
- NashStore 📱
- Galaxy Store 📱
- Google Play 📱: https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8907255934424789335

I'm still a student and just learning;) I am involved in several of my projects that will be released a little later. In the meantime, here are my products:
